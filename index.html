            <h2 class="text-success-2">How It Works</h2>
            <p>OpenBox platform uses Blockchain technology to enable nonprofits to bring more transparency into their fundraising process. Nonprofits control the level of detail and engagement they make available to their donors while the system’s “smart contract” technology manages all the processes and transactions accordingly.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6 col-xl-auto mb-5">

          <div class="col order-lg-first">
            <div class="pb-3 mb-3 mb-lg-4">
              <h3 class="text-success-4">Non Profits</h3>
              <p>Increase transparency by making your fundraising campaign details available to your donors. Plan and specify your campaign’s or project’s goals, needs and expenses such as products, services and overhead – all right within the platform. Easily convey your story and keep your donors informed and engaged and thus receive more donations</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pb-3 mb-3 mb-lg-4">
              <h3 class="text-success-3">Donors</h3>
              <p>Whether it is products, professional services, sponsorships, billing, wages or overhead costs, see what it is the organization needs and why, where they are getting it from and how much it costs. Once you decide to donate, OpenBox will allow you to watch your money arrive there, track progress, stay informed and ensure positive impact.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pb-3 mb-3 mb-lg-4">
              <h3 class="text-success-2">Foundations</h3>
              <p>Prioritize the funding interests of your foundation by ensuring accountability of grantees. The platform automatically tracks project progress and milestones and makes disbursements to appropriate vendors once all agreed conditions are met. Keep the process under control and board and supporters engaged while achieving the desired impact.</p>

            <h2 class="text-success-2">The Team</h2>
            <p>At OpenBox we strive to solve the biggest problem plaguing the nonprofit sector today - transparency, or rather, the lack thereof. Nonprofits are suffering from a decline in donors’ trust and confidence due to instances of misappropriation of funds, corruption and operational inefficiencies. 35% of those surveyed in the US have expressed little to no trust in nonprofit organizations. 33% of the donors reported reductions of their donations, specifically due to lack of transparency. As a result, more than 50% of US charities are not reaching their funding goals.</p>
            <p>OpenBox technology can and will reverse this situation. Our mission is to provide tools to enable nonprofit organizations to reach their funding goals with transparency. Our platform ensures that all donations, grants and gifts are utilized exactly as they were intended by the donor. The result: donors’ ever increasing demand for transparency and accountability is satisfied; nonprofits’ funding goals are reached with ease; but more importantly, nonprofits have the resources needed to fulfill their mission.</p>
